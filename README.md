# Nottingham City Transport Bus Departures API

![Nottingham City Transport Bus at Forest Recreation Ground](bus_at_forest_rec.jpg)

## Overview

My local bus company [Nottingham City Transport](https://www.nctx.co.uk/) doesn't have an API for real time bus departures, and I couldn't find any other source of this data so I decided to make my own using [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and a [screen scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) approach.

If you build a front end or interface to this, I'd love to see it.  You can [get hold of me here](https://simonprickett.dev/contact/).

## Running Locally

To run this locally, you'll need:

* [Git command line tools](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - to clone the project.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - use the latest long term stable (LTS) version.
* Cloudflare Wrangler - a tool for developing and deploying Cloudflare Workers (requires a free [Cloudflare account](https://www.cloudflare.com/))
* A web browser, anything will do but I like [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

First, get the code:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/simonprickett/nctx-stop-api.git
$ cd nctx-stop-api
```

Next, you'll need to get your Cloudflare account ID... TODO

Set the environment variable `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` to your account ID like so:

```bash
$ export CF_ACCOUNT_ID=<your account id>
```

Follow the [Wrangler instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/authentication/) to authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account.  

Now, you're ready to start a local copy of the worker:

```bash
$ wrangler dev
üíÅ  watching "./"
üëÇ  Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

## Deploying to Cloudflare Workers

When you're ready to publish the worker to the world and give it a public URL that's part of your Cloudflare account, use Wrangler:

```bash
$ wrangler publish
‚ú®  Basic JavaScript project found. Skipping unnecessary build!
‚ú®  Successfully published your script to
 https://nctx.<your Cloudflare workers domain>.workers.dev
```

Once deployed, your worker will be accessible on the internet at the URL that Wrangler outputs at the end of the publishing process.  Note that this is a `https` URL - Cloudflare takes care of SSL for you.

## Usage

### Obtaining a Bus Stop ID

This API works  at the bus stop level, there's no endpoints to get a list of routes or stops.  To make it work you'll need a bus stop ID.  You can get one of these from the [Nottingham City Transport website](https://www.nctx.co.uk/) like so:

* Go to the Nottingham City Transport home page.
* Enter a location into the "Live Departures" search box (example locations: "Sherwood", "Gotham", "Victoria Centre"), or click "find your stop on the map".
* A map appears showing bus stops near your location - pick one and click on it.
* A pop up appears, click "Departures"
* You should now be looking at the live departure board for a stop.  The stop ID is the final part of the page URL, for example given the URL `https://www.nctx.co.uk/stops/3390J1`, the stop ID is `3390J1`.
* Make a note of your stop ID and use it in the examples below. 

### Requesting Departure Data for a Bus Stop

The following examples all use stop ID `3390FO07` ("Forest Recreation Ground"), and route numbers and line colours that pass through that stop.

All examples are `GET` requests, so you can just use a browser to try them out.  You could also use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).  These examples assume you're running the worker code locally, just swap the URL to your production one if you've deployed it and want to run it in production.

#### Get All Departures

To get all the departures for a given stop ID go to the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8787/?stopId=3390FO07
```

This returns a JSON response that looks like this:

```json
{
  "stopId": "3390FO07",
  "stopName": "Forest Recreation Ground",
  "departures": [
    {
      "lineColour": "#FED100",
      "line": "yellow",
      "routeNumber": "70",
      "destination": "City, Victoria Centre T3",
      "expected": "2 mins",
      "expectedMins": 2,
      "isRealTime": true
    },
    {
      "lineColour": "#935E3A",
      "line": "brown",
      "routeNumber": "16",
      "destination": "City, Victoria Centre T2",
      "expected": "3 mins",
      "expectedMins": 3,
      "isRealTime": true
    },
    {
      "lineColour": "#522398",
      "line": "purple",
      "routeNumber": "88",
      "destination": "City, Parliament St P4",
      "expected": "5 mins",
      "expectedMins": 5,
      "isRealTime": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The `stopId` field contains the ID of the stop that you provided.  `stopName` contains the full name for that stop.  The remainder of the response is contained in the `departures` array.  Each departure has the following data fields:

* `lineColour`: a string containing the HTML colour code for the line that the bus is on.  The buses run on colour coded lines, each line may contain up to three or four route numbers and all buses on the same line colour head in roughly the same direction.
* `line`: a string containing the name of the line that the bus is on.  This is lowercase.  See later in this document for a list of possible values.
* `routeNumber`: a string containing the route number.  It's a string not a number because some routes have letters in them e.g. `N1`, `59A`, `1C`, `69X`.
* `destination`: where the bus route terminates / where the bus is headed to.  This is a string.
* `expected`: when the bus is expected to arrive at the stop.  This is a string value that takes one of two forms: `<number> mins` or `<hh>:<mm>` with the hours in 24 hour format.
* `expectedMins`: the number of minutes until the bus is expected to arrive at the stop.  This will be an integer number, and `0` if the bus is due at the stop now.
* `isRealTime`: is a boolean that will be `true` if this departure is a real time estimate (the bus has tracking on it) or `false` otherwise... the bus either doesn't have tracking or hasn't started on the route yet, so timetable information is shown instead.

### Filtering / Limiting Data Returned

There are various ways in which you can filter and limit the data returned.  These are all specified using extra parameters on the request, and can be combined together in a single request.

Use the filters by adding additional request parameters:

* `line` - to filter by a specific line colour using the line's name e.g. `&line=yellow`.  Valid values for `line` are (note these are case sensitive):
  * `brown`
  * `green`
  * `red`
  * `pink`
  * `turquoise`
  * `orange`
  * `skyblue`
  * `lilac`
  * `yellow`
  * `purple`
  * `navy`
  * `grey`
  * `blue`
  * `lime`
* `lineColour` - to filter by a specific line colour using the line's HTML colour code e.g. `&lineColour=#3FCFD5`.  Valid values for `lineColour` are (note these are case sensitive):
  * `#935E3A` (brown)
  * `#007A4D` (green)
  * `#CD202C` (red)
  * `#DA487E` (pink)
  * `#3FCFD5` (turquoise)
  * `#E37222` (orange)
  * `#6AADE4` (skyblue)
  * `#C1AFE5` (lilac)
  * `#FED100` (yellow)
  * `#522398` (purple)
  * `#002663` (navy)
  * `#B5B6B3` (grey)
  * `#00A1DE` (blue)
  * `#92D400` (lime)
* `routeNumber` - to filter by a specific route number.  This will also return variants of that route number for example `&routeNumber=69` will return `69`, `69A`, `69X` etc.  `&routeNumber=69X` will only return `69X`.
* `realTimeOnly` - set to true to return only departures that have real time estimates (where the bus is reporting its live location).  Example: `&realTimeOnly=true`.  Note: Setting `realTimeOnly` to any value whatsover turns on this filter.
* `maxWaitTime` - use to filter departures that are due in the next so many minutes.  Example: `&maxWaitTime=10`.
* `maxResults` - only return the first so many results (or fewer if there aren't that many matches).  To get the first 5: `&maxResults=5`.

Example showing how to combine these... let's get up to 4 yellow line departures in the next 60 mins:

```
http://localhost:8787/?stopId=3390FO07&line=yellow&maxWaitTime=60&maxResults=4
```

The order of the arguments doens't matter.

### Specifying the Format for Data Returned

The worker can return data in two different formats...

#### JSON Responses

JSON is the default response format, which is described earlier in this document.  There's no need to do this but you can set the `format` request parameter to `json` if you like:

```
http://localhost:8787/?stopId=3390FO07&maxResults=3&format=json
```

The response looks like this:

```json
{
  "stopId": "3390FO07",
  "stopName": "Forest Recreation Ground",
  "departures": [
    {
      "lineColour": "#FED100",
      "line": "yellow",
      "routeNumber": "69",
      "destination": "City, Victoria Centre T4",
      "expected": "1 min",
      "expectedMins": 1,
      "isRealTime": true
    },
    {
      "lineColour": "#935E3A",
      "line": "brown",
      "routeNumber": "15",
      "destination": "City, Victoria Centre T2",
      "expected": "2 mins",
      "expectedMins": 2,
      "isRealTime": true
    },
    {
      "lineColour": "#FED100",
      "line": "yellow",
      "routeNumber": "68",
      "destination": "City, Victoria Centre T4",
      "expected": "4 mins",
      "expectedMins": 4,
      "isRealTime": true
    }
  ]
}
```

If you opt to use the `fields` request parameter, only the fields you ask for will be returned:

```
http://localhost:8787/?stopId=3390FO07&format=json&maxResults=3&fields=line,routeNumber,expected
```

returns:

```json
{
  "stopId": "3390FO07",
  "stopName": "Forest Recreation Ground",
  "departures": [
    {
      "line": "yellow",
      "routeNumber": "69",
      "expected": "1 min"
    },
    {
      "line": "brown",
      "routeNumber": "15",
      "expected": "2 mins"
    },
    {
      "line": "yellow",
      "routeNumber": "68",
      "expected": "5 mins"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Delimited String Responses

The worker can also return delimited string responses.  You might want to use these when processing the response on a device with limited capabilities, where a JSON parser might not be viable.  To get a string response set the `format` request parameter to `string`:

```
http://localhost:8787/?stopId=3390FO07&format=string&maxResults=3
```

The response format looks like this:

```
3390FO07|Forest Recreation Ground|#FED100^yellow^68^City, Victoria Centre T4^1 min^1^true|^#92D400^lime^56^City, Parliament St P2^4 mins^4^true|^#522398^purple^89^City, Parliament St P5^5 mins^5^true
```

The following fields are returned, separated by `|` characters:

* The stop ID.
* The stop name.
* Each departure.

Within each departure, fields are separated by `^` characters.  If you choose to filter which fields are returned using the `fields` request parameter, those fields will be omitted without returning a blank value.  For example:

```
http://localhost:8787/?stopId=3390FO07&format=string&maxResults=3&fields=line,routeNumber,expected
```

Returns:

```
3390FO07|Forest Recreation Ground|yellow^69^1 min|^brown^15^2 mins|^yellow^68^4 mins
```
